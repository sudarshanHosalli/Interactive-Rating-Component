# Frontend Mentor - Interactive Rating Component Solution

This is my solution to the [Interactive Rating Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). This challenge helped me improve my coding skills by building a realistic, interactive web component.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Select and submit a number rating.
- View a "Thank you" message after submitting the rating.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Working on this project, I learned how to:

1. Dynamically render HTML elements with JavaScript and update DOM interactions in real-time.
2. Handle user input and create feedback mechanisms based on button clicks.
3. Use mobile-first design principles to create responsive layouts.

Hereâ€™s an example of how I dynamically added buttons and handled user interaction with JavaScript:

```js
mainContainer.innerHTML = `
  <div class="btns">
    <button class="btn">1</button>
    <button class="btn">2</button>
    <button class="btn">3</button>
    <button class="btn">4</button>
    <button class="btn">5</button>
  </div>`;
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my JavaScript skills by exploring more advanced DOM manipulation techniques.
- Continue working with responsive design, especially when building components that scale well on various devices.
- Dive deeper into accessibility best practices to ensure my projects are usable by all users.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was a very helpful resource for understanding Flexbox, which I used to align and space elements in this project.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN documentation was invaluable for JavaScript event handling.
